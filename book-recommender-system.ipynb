From e-commerce (suggest to buyers articles that could interest them) to online advertisement (suggest to users the right contents, matching their preferences), recommender systems are today unavoidable in our daily online journeys.\n","In a very general way, recommender systems are algorithms aimed at suggesting relevant items to users (items being movies to watch, text to read, products to buy or anything else depending on industries).\n","\n","Recommender systems are really critical in some industries as they can generate a huge amount of income when they are efficient or also be a way to stand out significantly from competitors. As a proof of the importance of recommender systems, we can mention that, a few years ago, Netflix organised a challenges (the “Netflix prize”) where the goal was to produce a recommender system that performs better than its own algorithm with a prize of 1 million dollars to win.\n","# Intorduction\n","This notebook explores the application of Popularity Based Recommender System and Collaborative Filtering (CF) Based Recommender System in building a book recommendation system. CF leverages the wisdom of the crowd, drawing insights from the reading preferences of other users to suggest books you might enjoy. By analyzing user-book interactions, the system identifies patterns and similarities between readers, ultimately recommending titles aligned with your tastes."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"a8ff8c55","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-09-02T17:49:25.373359Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-09-02T17:49:25.372797Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-09-02T17:49:25.784642Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-09-02T17:49:25.783404Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.424022,"end_time":"2024-09-02T17:49:25.787154","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-09-02T17:49:25.363132","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[],"source":["import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"f1912ce0","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.008089,"end_time":"2024-09-02T17:49:25.803977","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-09-02T17:49:25.795888","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["# Dataset\n","The dataset comprises 3 files.\n","\n","### Users:\n","Contains the users.
